# wheatfutures
Get a bot to trade wheat futures to make $$$

**Steps** 
1) Analyze datasets (something with AI/ML?) to predict where wheat price gonna go (how exactly im going to do this idk but there should be some guide that I should look at) 
3) Learn how to select which futures (arguably hard bc you have to weigh risk reward) 
4) Risk metrics (when to sell, what are our breach levels)
5) Put in orders, sell, etc (seems the easiest ngl)
6) Backtest (idk how to do this but seems easiest enough)
7) Add NLP bs to look at data 

**Things to watch out for**
 bro idk how to use github pull/push bs so i might fuck this up
